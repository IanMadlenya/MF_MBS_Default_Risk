# Analysis of Multifamily Mortgage Default Probabilities

## Project Overview:
The focus of this analysis is to approximate the probability of default for multifamily mortgages. Machine learning algorithms will be applied to data provided publicly by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). This data is for existing multifamily loans. The resulting probabilities are unique to each loan. You can view the everything from the initial exploratory data analysis to the final results at (AWS link provided).
